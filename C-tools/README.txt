All programs mlbin, mldat, and mlterm can be compiled under Linux, MAC OS-X.

Using a console go into the respective folder and enter the following commands to install the software:

make
sudo make install

mlterm will not run under Windows. Windows binaries of the other programs can be downloaded at 

http://sourceforge.net/projects/corkobservatory/files

For windows, make sure you keep the cygwin.dll with the exe files.

== All operating systems

To calibrate raw readings and output engenering units, mldat and mlbin rely on the *.txt files that can be downloaded at

http://corkobservatory.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/corkobservatory/CalibrationFiles/

Note, that it is easy to keep them current if you check the calibration files out using SVN version control...
