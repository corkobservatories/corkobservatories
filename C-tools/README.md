All programs mlbin, mldat, and mlterm can be compiled under Linux, MAC OS-X.

Using a console go into the respective folder and enter the following commands to install the software:

make
sudo make install

mlterm will not run under Windows. Windows binaries of the other programs can be downloaded at 

https://github.com/corkobservatories/corkobservatories/releases

For windows, make sure you keep the cygwin.dll with the exe files.

=== All operating systems

To calibrate raw readings and output engenering units, mldat and mlbin rely on the \*.txt files that can be downloaded from the repository: https://github.com/corkobservatories/corkobservatories/tree/master/CalibrationFiles

All four files can be downloaded as [zip-archive](https://github.com/corkobservatories/corkobservatories/tree/master/CalibrationFiles) with the help of [DownGit](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit)

https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/corkobservatories/corkobservatories/tree/master/CalibrationFiles

Note, that it is easy to keep them current if you check the calibration files out using SVN version control...
