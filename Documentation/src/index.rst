   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to CORK and BPR documentation!
=======================================

The wiki
http://www.corkobservatories.org/pmwiki/index.php

Unfortunately, the wiki site is not very well maintained in the moment.

I do maintain a version controlled software repository that contains all the programs that you need to deal with CORKs and the downloaded data:
http://corkobservatory.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/corkobservatory/

This repository is used to keep the computers that are used to download data updated and in sync. It also contains all calibration and site information (see CalibrationFiles) and the details of the instrument configurations (see ParameterFiles). If you want to contribute to that information, you need to install subversion (svn) to stay up to date and push new updates to the software repository. Or you can ask me to make the modifications. I also use the repository the maintain some documentation of the software that you can access here:
http://corkobservatory.sourceforge.net/
